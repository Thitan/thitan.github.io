  <h1>About me </h1>
  I am a PhD student in Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, UK, where I work at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.
  I was born in Hanoi and moved to Berlin when I was a young kid. I am interested in almost anything. I sometimes wish I had lived in the Renaissance
  where one could be a polymath poking into different fields of study.
  I obtained my MD and MSc in Neuroscience in 2011 from the Charit√© Medical School in Berlin 
  and was a research fellow at Yale University from 2008 - 2009. 
  
  Feel free to read about my PhD
  research and listen to my original music compositions. I am also passionate about traveling and exploring different cuisines
